## Code

Results from an experiment to compare yields (as measured by dried weight of plants) obtained under a control and two different treatment conditions.

The following is the `R` source code:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(datasets)
library(plotly)

plot_ly(
  data = PlantGrowth,
  x = ~ group,
  y = ~ weight,
  color = ~ as.factor(group),
  colors = "Dark2",
  size = 5,
  type = "box"
) %>% layout(title = "Plant Growth")
```

## Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(datasets)
library(plotly)

plot_ly(
  data = PlantGrowth,
  x = ~ group,
  y = ~ weight,
  color = ~ as.factor(group),
  colors = "Dark2",
  size = 5,
  type = "box"
) %>% layout(title = "Plant Growth")
```
